# •	Study and analysis of a queuing system using ARENA software 

In this project, a simulation model of a barbershop was created using ARENA software. Performance measures, such as the average waiting time in the system and the average number of customers in the queue were evaluated. The system faced the highest traffic during the evening and the lowest traffic in the morning. Using the ARENA simulation software, we built the model and analyzed the output applying ‘’what if’’’ analysis to produce alternate results.
